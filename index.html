        <h1>Hey! I'm Isiah Toilalo</h1>
        <p>I am a current student at Western Sydney University. In my free time I like to play around with many different applications, particularly Adobe Suites. But this time I have learnt how to code up a website. So I thought it would be best practice if I built my portfolio to continue to log all of my work. Initially, my portfolio was okay but I think having much more control over the settings will make it look so much better. Enjoy browing all of my work. </p>
